        <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>   
            <ol>
                <li>First we want to make the dough. In a bowl, combine
                    the water, white sugar, yeast, salt, vegetable oil, and flour. </li>
                <li>Knead the dough/ingredients by hand or with a rice scoop</li>
                <li>Let the dough rise covered for an hour.</li>
                <li>After an hour, knead the dough again and let it rise covered for another 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Next is to make the filling for the dough!</li>
                <li>Mix the turbinado sugar, walnuts, and cinammon in a bowl.</li> 
                <li>knead the dough one more time to get all the air bubbles out.</li>
                <li>Grab a palm size amount of dough, grab some of the filling and form a ball with the dough around the 
                    fillings.
                </li>
                <li>add some of the vegetable oil to a pan on medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Place 1 ball onto the pan and let it cook for around 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>When the bottom of the dough ball is a light golden brown, flip it over and press it down 
                    with a spatula to make a thin wide circle (around the size of a CD)
                </li>
                <li>Continue cooking and flipping until the outside is a golden 
                    brown and the filling inside has completely melted!</li>
            </ol>
