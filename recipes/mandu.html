                cabbage, tofu, mung bean noodles, and kimchi! You can prepare them in large quantities

                    noodles. </li>
                <li>Add the anchoby stock to water in a large, deep pan, and bring it to a boil. 
                    Once it boils, remove the stock packet and add the sauce that you made the
                     previous step into the pot.</li>
                <li>Once the sauce is boiling, add in the rice cake and fish cakes</li>
                <li>As you let it cook, the sauce should thicken and the rice/fish cakes should become soft and chewy</li>

                <li>Scoop into bowl and top with sesame seeds, green onions and sesame oil</li>
