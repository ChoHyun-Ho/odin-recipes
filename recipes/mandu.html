        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Korean dumplings, also known as mandu, are a traditional Korean food/street snack!
                These dumplings are stuffed with a mixture of meat and/or vegetables and have as many 
                variations as there are people in Korea! This recipe is made with ground pork, onion,
                cabbage, tofu, mung bean noodles, and kimchi! You can prepare them in large quantities
                and store them in the freezer for future cooking!
